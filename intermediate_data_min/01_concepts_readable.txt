================================================================================
CONCEPT 1: Power Rule for Integration
================================================================================
ID: power_rule_integration
Difficulty: easy
Prerequisites: differentiation_power_rule, algebraic_manipulation

Context:
This is the fundamental rule for integrating polynomial terms or any variable raised to a constant power, except for -1. The rule involves increasing the exponent by one and dividing by the new exponent.

Formula:
\int ax^n dx = \frac{ax^{n+1}}{n+1} + C, \quad n \neq -1

Worked Example:
Problem: Find $\int 3x^2 dx$. 
Solution: Using the power rule with n=2, we get $3 \cdot \frac{x^{2+1}}{2+1} + C = 3 \cdot \frac{x^3}{3} + C = x^3 + C$.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 2: Power Rule with Negative Exponents
================================================================================
ID: power_rule_integration_negative_exponent
Difficulty: easy
Prerequisites: power_rule_integration, properties_of_exponents

Context:
This is a direct application of the power rule to functions with variables in the denominator. The first step is to rewrite the expression with a negative exponent before applying the standard power rule.

Formula:
\int \frac{a}{x^n} dx = \int ax^{-n} dx = \frac{ax^{-n+1}}{-n+1} + C, \quad n \neq 1

Worked Example:
Problem: Find $\int \frac{4}{x^3} dx$. 
Solution: Rewrite as $\int 4x^{-3} dx$. Apply the power rule: $4 \frac{x^{-3+1}}{-3+1} + C = 4 \frac{x^{-2}}{-2} + C = -2x^{-2} + C = -\frac{2}{x^2} + C$.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 3: Integral of 1/x
================================================================================
ID: integral_of_one_over_x
Difficulty: easy
Prerequisites: power_rule_integration

Context:
This is the special case of the power rule where n = -1. The integral of 1/x is the natural logarithm of the absolute value of x, not another power function.

Formula:
\int \frac{1}{x} dx = \ln|x| + C

Worked Example:
Problem: Find $\int \frac{5}{x} dx$. 
Solution: This is $5 \int \frac{1}{x} dx = 5 \ln|x| + C$.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 4: Constant Multiple Rule for Integrals
================================================================================
ID: constant_multiple_rule_integration
Difficulty: easy
Prerequisites: basic_integration

Context:
This property states that a constant factor can be moved outside of an integral sign. It simplifies the process of integration by allowing you to focus on the variable part of the function.

Formula:
\int kf(x) dx = k \int f(x) dx

Worked Example:
Problem: Find $\int 7\cos(x) dx$. 
Solution: Using the rule, this becomes $7 \int \cos(x) dx = 7\sin(x) + C$.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 5: Sum and Difference Rule for Integrals
================================================================================
ID: sum_rule_integration
Difficulty: easy
Prerequisites: basic_integration

Context:
This rule allows you to integrate a function composed of several terms by integrating each term separately. It is essential for integrating any polynomial or sum of functions.

Formula:
\int [f(x) \pm g(x)] dx = \int f(x) dx \pm \int g(x) dx

Worked Example:
Problem: Find $\int (x^2 + e^x) dx$. 
Solution: $\int x^2 dx + \int e^x dx = \frac{x^3}{3} + e^x + C$.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 6: Integral of an Exponential Function (Base a)
================================================================================
ID: integral_general_exponential_function
Difficulty: easy
Prerequisites: logarithms, exponential_functions

Context:
This formula is used to integrate exponential functions where the base is a constant other than 'e'. The result is the original function divided by the natural logarithm of its base.

Formula:
\int a^x dx = \frac{a^x}{\ln a} + C

Worked Example:
Problem: Find $\int 4^{3x} dx$. 
Solution: Let u=3x, du=3dx, so dx=du/3. The integral is $\frac{1}{3} \int 4^u du = \frac{1}{3} \frac{4^u}{\ln 4} + C = \frac{4^{3x}}{3\ln 4} + C$.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 7: Standard Trigonometric Integrals
================================================================================
ID: integral_standard_trigonometric_functions
Difficulty: easy
Prerequisites: derivatives_of_trig_functions, u_substitution_linear

Context:
This is one of the basic trigonometric integrals derived directly from differentiation rules. Integrating secant squared of a linear argument results in the tangent function, adjusted for the constant 'a'.

Formula:
\int \sec^2(ax) dx = \frac{1}{a}\tan(ax) + C

Worked Example:
Problem: Find $\int \sec^2(5x) dx$. 
Solution: Using the formula with a=5, we get $\frac{1}{5}\tan(5x) + C$.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 8: Integration by Substitution Leading to a Logarithm
================================================================================
ID: integration_by_substitution_logarithmic_form
Difficulty: medium
Prerequisites: u_substitution, integral_of_one_over_x

Context:
This pattern arises frequently in u-substitution. If the numerator of a fraction is the derivative of the denominator, the integral is the natural logarithm of the absolute value of the denominator.

Formula:
\int \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)} dx = \ln|f(x)| + C

Worked Example:
Problem: Find $\int \frac{x}{x^2+8} dx$. 
Solution: Let $u = x^2+8$, then $du = 2x dx$, so $x dx = du/2$. The integral becomes $\int \frac{1}{u} \frac{du}{2} = \frac{1}{2}\ln|u| + C = \frac{1}{2}\ln(x^2+8) + C$, which is also $\ln(\sqrt{x^2+8}) + C$.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 9: Integration Using Power-Reducing Identities
================================================================================
ID: integration_with_power_reduction_identities
Difficulty: medium
Prerequisites: trigonometric_identities, basic_trig_integrals

Context:
To integrate even powers of sine or cosine, we use power-reducing identities to convert the integrand into a form that can be integrated directly. This transforms the squared function into functions with a double angle.

Formula:
\cos^2(ax) = \frac{1 + \cos(2ax)}{2}

Worked Example:
Problem: Find $\int \cos^2(3x) dx$. 
Solution: Use the identity: $\int \frac{1 + \cos(6x)}{2} dx = \frac{1}{2} \int (1 + \cos(6x)) dx = \frac{1}{2}(x + \frac{\sin(6x)}{6}) + C = \frac{x}{2} + \frac{\sin(6x)}{12} + C$.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 10: Integral of e^x [f(x) + f'(x)]
================================================================================
ID: special_form_integral_ex_f_plus_f_prime
Difficulty: medium
Prerequisites: product_rule_differentiation, integration_by_parts

Context:
This is a special integration pattern derived from the product rule. If an integrand can be identified in this form, it provides a shortcut that bypasses the need for integration by parts.

Formula:
\int e^x [f(x) + f'(x)] dx = e^x f(x) + C

Worked Example:
Problem: Find $\int e^x(\tan^{-1}x + \frac{1}{1+x^2})dx$. 
Solution: Let $f(x) = \tan^{-1}x$, so $f'(x) = \frac{1}{1+x^2}$. The integral is in the required form. The result is $e^x f(x) + C = e^x \tan^{-1}x + C$.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 11: Integration by Factoring with Trig Identities
================================================================================
ID: integration_using_trig_identities_and_substitution
Difficulty: medium
Prerequisites: trigonometric_identities, u_substitution

Context:
This technique involves factoring the integrand and using Pythagorean identities to create a form suitable for u-substitution. It is common when dealing with powers of tangent and secant.

Formula:
\tan^2(x) + 1 = \sec^2(x)

Worked Example:
Problem: Find $\int (\tan^4 x + \tan^2 x) dx$. 
Solution: Factor the integrand: $\int \tan^2 x (\tan^2 x + 1) dx = \int \tan^2 x \sec^2 x dx$. Let $u = \tan x$, so $du = \sec^2 x dx$. The integral becomes $\int u^2 du = \frac{u^3}{3} + C = \frac{\tan^3 x}{3} + C$.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 12: The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Evaluation)
================================================================================
ID: fundamental_theorem_of_calculus_part_2
Difficulty: easy
Prerequisites: antiderivatives

Context:
This theorem provides the method for evaluating definite integrals. It connects the concept of an antiderivative to the definite integral by stating that the integral's value is the net change in the antiderivative over the interval.

Formula:
\int_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a), \text{ where } F'(x)=f(x)

Worked Example:
Problem: Evaluate $\int_{0}^{1} (x+1)^2 dx$. 
Solution: First, find the antiderivative of $f(x) = (x+1)^2$. $F(x) = \frac{(x+1)^3}{3}$. Now evaluate $F(1) - F(0) = \frac{(1+1)^3}{3} - \frac{(0+1)^3}{3} = \frac{2^3}{3} - \frac{1^3}{3} = \frac{8}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{7}{3}$.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 13: Additivity Property of Definite Integrals
================================================================================
ID: property_definite_integral_additivity
Difficulty: medium
Prerequisites: definite_integrals

Context:
This property allows you to split a definite integral into two or more integrals over adjacent intervals. It is useful for piecewise functions or when given information about integrals over different intervals.

Formula:
\int_a^c f(x) dx = \int_a^b f(x) dx + \int_b^c f(x) dx

Worked Example:
Problem: Given $\int_1^3 g(x) dx = -3$ and $\int_3^8 g(x) dx = 10$, find $\int_1^8 3g(x) dx$. 
Solution: First, find $\int_1^8 g(x) dx = \int_1^3 g(x) dx + \int_3^8 g(x) dx = -3 + 10 = 7$. Then, $\int_1^8 3g(x) dx = 3 \int_1^8 g(x) dx = 3(7) = 21$.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 14: Definite Integral of an Odd Function over a Symmetric Interval
================================================================================
ID: definite_integral_odd_function_symmetric_interval
Difficulty: medium
Prerequisites: properties_of_definite_integrals, identifying_odd_and_even_functions

Context:
This property is a shortcut for definite integrals. If a function is odd (symmetric about the origin) and integrated over a symmetric interval (like -a to a), the positive and negative areas cancel out, resulting in zero.

Formula:
\text{If } f(-x) = -f(x), \text{ then } \int_{-a}^{a} f(x) dx = 0

Worked Example:
Problem: Evaluate $\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \sin(x) dx$. 
Solution: Let $f(x) = \sin(x)$. $f(-x) = \sin(-x) = -\sin(x) = -f(x)$. Since the function is odd and the interval is symmetric, the integral is 0.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 15: Definite Integral of an Even Function over a Symmetric Interval
================================================================================
ID: definite_integral_even_function_symmetric_interval
Difficulty: medium
Prerequisites: properties_of_definite_integrals, identifying_odd_and_even_functions

Context:
For even functions (symmetric about the y-axis), the integral over a symmetric interval is twice the integral from 0 to the upper limit. This can simplify calculations, especially when 0 is an easier limit to work with.

Formula:
\text{If } f(-x) = f(x), \text{ then } \int_{-a}^{a} f(x) dx = 2\int_{0}^{a} f(x) dx

Worked Example:
Problem: Evaluate $\int_{-2}^{2} x^2 dx$. 
Solution: $f(x)=x^2$ is an even function. So, $\int_{-2}^{2} x^2 dx = 2\int_{0}^{2} x^2 dx = 2[\frac{x^3}{3}]_0^2 = 2(\frac{8}{3} - 0) = \frac{16}{3}$.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 16: Solving Basic Separable Differential Equations
================================================================================
ID: solving_basic_separable_differential_equation
Difficulty: easy
Prerequisites: indefinite_integration

Context:
This is the simplest form of a differential equation, where the rate of change of y depends only on x. The solution is found by directly integrating the function of x.

Formula:
\text{If } \frac{dy}{dx} = f(x), \text{ then } y = \int f(x) dx

Worked Example:
Problem: Find the general solution of $\frac{dy}{dx} = x^4 + 12$. 
Solution: Integrate with respect to x: $y = \int (x^4 + 12) dx = \frac{x^5}{5} + 12x + C$.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 17: Order of a Differential Equation and Arbitrary Constants
================================================================================
ID: order_of_de_and_arbitrary_constants
Difficulty: easy
Prerequisites: differential_equations_definition

Context:
A fundamental concept in differential equations is that the general solution to an nth-order differential equation must contain exactly n essential arbitrary constants. Each integration step in the solution process introduces one constant.

Formula:
N/A

Worked Example:
Problem: How many arbitrary constants are in the general solution of $y''' - 2y' + y = 0$? 
Solution: The order of the DE is the highest derivative, which is 3. Therefore, the general solution contains 3 arbitrary constants.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 18: Geometric Interpretation of the Definite Integral
================================================================================
ID: geometric_interpretation_definite_integral
Difficulty: easy
Prerequisites: graphing_functions

Context:
For a non-negative function, the definite integral from a to b represents the area of the region bounded by the function's graph, the x-axis, and the vertical lines x=a and x=b. If the function is negative, the integral represents the negative of the area.

Formula:
Area = \int_a^b f(x) dx \quad (\text{for } f(x) \ge 0)

Worked Example:
Problem: What does $\int_0^2 (x+1) dx$ represent geometrically? 
Solution: It represents the area of the trapezoid under the line y=x+1, above the x-axis, between x=0 and x=2.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 19: The Constant of Integration
================================================================================
ID: concept_antiderivative_and_constant_of_integration
Difficulty: easy
Prerequisites: derivatives

Context:
An indefinite integral represents a family of functions (all possible antiderivatives), not a single function. Any two antiderivatives of the same function differ only by a constant, known as the constant of integration, C.

Formula:
\text{If } F'(x) = f(x), \text{ then } \int f(x) dx = F(x) + C

Worked Example:
Problem: If $\Phi_1(x) = x^2$ and $\Phi_2(x) = x^2 + 5$ are two antiderivatives of $f(x)=2x$, what is their difference? 
Solution: $\Phi_1(x) - \Phi_2(x) = x^2 - (x^2 + 5) = -5$, which is a constant.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 20: Integration by Parts
================================================================================
ID: integration_by_parts
Difficulty: hard
Prerequisites: product_rule_differentiation, u_substitution

Context:
This technique is the integration equivalent of the product rule for differentiation. It is used to integrate products of functions, such as a polynomial and an exponential, by transforming the integral into one that is easier to solve.

Formula:
\int u dv = uv - \int v du

Worked Example:
Problem: Find $\int x e^x dx$. 
Solution: Let $u=x$ and $dv=e^x dx$. Then $du=dx$ and $v=e^x$. Using the formula: $\int x e^x dx = x e^x - \int e^x dx = x e^x - e^x + C$.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 21: Integrals Leading to Inverse Tangent
================================================================================
ID: integral_leading_to_arctan
Difficulty: medium
Prerequisites: derivatives_of_inverse_trig_functions

Context:
This is a standard integration form that results in the inverse tangent function. Recognizing this pattern is key to solving integrals of rational functions where the denominator is a sum of squares.

Formula:
\int \frac{1}{a^2 + x^2} dx = \frac{1}{a} \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) + C

Worked Example:
Problem: Find $\int \frac{3}{9+x^2} dx$. 
Solution: Here, $a^2=9$, so $a=3$. The integral is $3 \int \frac{1}{3^2+x^2} dx = 3 \left(\frac{1}{3} \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{3}\right)\right) + C = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{3}\right) + C$.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 22: Integrals Leading to Inverse Sine
================================================================================
ID: integral_leading_to_arcsin
Difficulty: medium
Prerequisites: derivatives_of_inverse_trig_functions

Context:
This standard integration form results in the inverse sine function. It applies to integrands where the denominator is the square root of a constant squared minus a variable squared.

Formula:
\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}} dx = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) + C

Worked Example:
Problem: Find $\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{16-x^2}} dx$. 
Solution: Here, $a^2=16$, so $a=4$. Using the formula, the integral is $\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{4}\right) + C$.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 23: Trigonometric Substitution with Sine
================================================================================
ID: trigonometric_substitution_sine
Difficulty: hard
Prerequisites: integration_by_substitution, trigonometric_identities, inverse_trig_functions

Context:
Trigonometric substitution is a technique for handling integrals containing radical expressions. When the radical is of the form $\sqrt{a^2-x^2}$, substituting $x=a\sin\theta$ simplifies the radical using the identity $1-\sin^2\theta = \cos^2\theta$.

Formula:
\text{For } \sqrt{a^2-x^2}, \text{ use } x = a\sin\theta

Worked Example:
Problem: Find $\int \sqrt{4-x^2} dx$. 
Solution: Let $x = 2\sin\theta$, $dx=2\cos\theta d\theta$. The integral becomes $\int \sqrt{4-4\sin^2\theta} (2\cos\theta) d\theta = \int 2\cos\theta (2\cos\theta) d\theta = 4\int \cos^2\theta d\theta$, which can then be solved using power reduction.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 24: Average Value of a Function
================================================================================
ID: average_value_of_a_function
Difficulty: medium
Prerequisites: definite_integrals, fundamental_theorem_of_calculus_part_2

Context:
The average value of a continuous function over an interval is found by integrating the function over that interval and then dividing by the length of the interval. Geometrically, it represents the height of a rectangle with the same area as the region under the curve.

Formula:
f_{\text{avg}} = \frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b f(x) dx

Worked Example:
Problem: Find the average value of $f(x) = x^2$ on the interval $[0, 3]$. 
Solution: $f_{\text{avg}} = \frac{1}{3-0} \int_0^3 x^2 dx = \frac{1}{3} [\frac{x^3}{3}]_0^3 = \frac{1}{3} (\frac{27}{3} - 0) = \frac{1}{3}(9) = 3$.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 25: Area Between Two Curves
================================================================================
ID: area_between_curves
Difficulty: medium
Prerequisites: definite_integrals, graphing_functions

Context:
The area of the region enclosed between two curves is calculated by integrating the difference between the upper function and the lower function over the interval defined by their intersection points.

Formula:
A = \int_a^b (f(x) - g(x)) dx, \text{ where } f(x) \ge g(x)

Worked Example:
Problem: Find the area between $y=x$ and $y=x^2$. 
Solution: The curves intersect at x=0 and x=1. On [0,1], $x \ge x^2$. Area = $\int_0^1 (x - x^2) dx = [\frac{x^2}{2} - \frac{x^3}{3}]_0^1 = (\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3}) - 0 = \frac{1}{6}$.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 26: Integration by Partial Fractions (Distinct Linear Factors)
================================================================================
ID: partial_fraction_decomposition_linear
Difficulty: hard
Prerequisites: algebra_of_polynomials, integration_leading_to_logarithms

Context:
This technique is used to integrate rational functions. If the denominator can be factored into distinct linear factors, the original fraction can be decomposed into a sum of simpler fractions, each of which can be integrated easily (usually to a natural logarithm).

Formula:
\frac{P(x)}{(x-a)(x-b)} = \frac{A}{x-a} + \frac{B}{x-b}

Worked Example:
Problem: Find $\int \frac{1}{x^2-4} dx$. 
Solution: Decompose $\frac{1}{(x-2)(x+2)} = \frac{A}{x-2} + \frac{B}{x+2}$. Solving gives A=1/4, B=-1/4. The integral is $\int (\frac{1/4}{x-2} - \frac{1/4}{x+2})dx = \frac{1}{4}\ln|x-2| - \frac{1}{4}\ln|x+2| + C$.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 27: Volume of Revolution: Disk Method
================================================================================
ID: volume_by_disk_method
Difficulty: hard
Prerequisites: area_under_a_curve, definite_integrals

Context:
The disk method is used to find the volume of a solid of revolution. It applies when the area being revolved is flush against the axis of revolution, creating a solid with no hole. The formula sums the volumes of infinitesimally thin circular disks.

Formula:
V = \pi \int_a^b [R(x)]^2 dx

Worked Example:
Problem: Find the volume of the solid formed by revolving the region under $y=\sqrt{x}$ from x=0 to x=4 about the x-axis. 
Solution: The radius is $R(x)=\sqrt{x}$. Volume $V = \pi \int_0^4 (\sqrt{x})^2 dx = \pi \int_0^4 x dx = \pi [\frac{x^2}{2}]_0^4 = \pi (\frac{16}{2} - 0) = 8\pi$.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 28: Volume of Revolution: Washer Method
================================================================================
ID: volume_by_washer_method
Difficulty: hard
Prerequisites: volume_by_disk_method

Context:
The washer method is an extension of the disk method for solids of revolution with a hole. It calculates the volume by subtracting the volume of the inner hole from the volume of the outer solid. R(x) is the outer radius and r(x) is the inner radius.

Formula:
V = \pi \int_a^b ([R(x)]^2 - [r(x)]^2) dx

Worked Example:
Problem: Find the volume of the solid formed by revolving the region between $y=x$ and $y=x^2$ about the x-axis. 
Solution: On [0,1], $R(x)=x$ and $r(x)=x^2$. $V = \pi \int_0^1 (x^2 - (x^2)^2) dx = \pi \int_0^1 (x^2 - x^4) dx = \pi [\frac{x^3}{3} - \frac{x^5}{5}]_0^1 = \pi (\frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{5}) = \frac{2\pi}{15}$.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 29: Improper Integrals with Infinite Limits
================================================================================
ID: improper_integral_infinite_limit
Difficulty: hard
Prerequisites: definite_integrals, limits_at_infinity

Context:
Improper integrals are definite integrals where one or both of the limits of integration are infinite. They are evaluated by replacing the infinite limit with a variable and then taking the limit of the resulting integral.

Formula:
\int_a^\infty f(x) dx = \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_a^b f(x) dx

Worked Example:
Problem: Evaluate $\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x^2} dx$. 
Solution: $\lim_{b \to \infty} \int_1^b x^{-2} dx = \lim_{b \to \infty} [-\frac{1}{x}]_1^b = \lim_{b \to \infty} (-\frac{1}{b} - (-\frac{1}{1})) = 0 + 1 = 1$.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 30: The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Derivative of an Integral)
================================================================================
ID: ftc_part_1
Difficulty: medium
Prerequisites: definite_integrals, derivatives

Context:
The first part of the FTC relates differentiation and integration as inverse operations. It states that the derivative of an integral function (where the upper limit is the variable) is the original function itself.

Formula:
\frac{d}{dx} \int_a^x f(t) dt = f(x)

Worked Example:
Problem: Find $\frac{d}{dx} \int_2^x \cos(t^2) dt$. 
Solution: According to FTC Part 1, the derivative is simply the integrand with t replaced by x: $\cos(x^2)$.
