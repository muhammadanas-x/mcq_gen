================================================================================
CONCEPT 1: Power Rule for Integration
================================================================================
ID: power_rule_integration
Difficulty: easy

Context:
This is the fundamental rule for finding the antiderivative of a variable raised to a constant power. It is the reverse of the power rule for differentiation and is used extensively in integrating polynomial functions.

Formula:
\int x^n dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C, \text{ for } n \neq -1

Worked Example:
Problem: Find \int x^4 dx.
Solution: Using the power rule with n=4, we get \frac{x^{4+1}}{4+1} + C = \frac{x^5}{5} + C.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 2: Integration of 1/x
================================================================================
ID: integration_of_one_over_x
Difficulty: easy
Prerequisites: power_rule_integration

Context:
This rule covers the specific case of the power rule where n = -1. The integral of 1/x is the natural logarithm of the absolute value of x, a crucial formula in calculus.

Formula:
\int \frac{1}{x} dx = \ln|x| + C

Worked Example:
Problem: Find \int \frac{5}{x} dx.
Solution: Using the constant multiple rule and the rule for 1/x, we get 5 \int \frac{1}{x} dx = 5 \ln|x| + C.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 3: Constant Multiple Rule for Integration
================================================================================
ID: constant_multiple_rule_integration
Difficulty: easy

Context:
This property allows constant factors to be moved outside of the integral sign, simplifying the integration process. It applies to both definite and indefinite integrals.

Formula:
\int k f(x) dx = k \int f(x) dx

Worked Example:
Problem: Find \int 3\cos(x) dx.
Solution: We can pull the constant 3 out: 3 \int \cos(x) dx = 3\sin(x) + C.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 4: Sum and Difference Rule for Integration
================================================================================
ID: sum_difference_rule_integration
Difficulty: easy

Context:
This rule states that the integral of a sum or difference of functions is the sum or difference of their individual integrals. This allows us to break down complex integrands into simpler parts.

Formula:
\int [f(x) \pm g(x)] dx = \int f(x) dx \pm \int g(x) dx

Worked Example:
Problem: Find \int (x^2 + e^x) dx.
Solution: We integrate term by term: \int x^2 dx + \int e^x dx = \frac{x^3}{3} + e^x + C.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 5: Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 1
================================================================================
ID: fundamental_theorem_of_calculus_part1
Difficulty: easy
Prerequisites: definition_of_integral

Context:
This theorem establishes the crucial link between differentiation and integration, showing they are inverse operations. It states that the derivative of an integral function with a variable upper limit is the original function itself.

Formula:
\frac{d}{dx} \int_a^x f(t) dt = f(x)

Worked Example:
Problem: Find \frac{d}{dx} \int_2^x \sin(t^2) dt.
Solution: By FTC Part 1, the derivative is simply the integrand with t replaced by x: \sin(x^2).


================================================================================
CONCEPT 6: Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2 (Evaluation Theorem)
================================================================================
ID: fundamental_theorem_of_calculus_part2
Difficulty: easy
Prerequisites: power_rule_integration

Context:
This theorem provides the method for evaluating definite integrals. To find the value, one must find an antiderivative F(x) of the integrand f(x) and then compute the difference in its value at the upper and lower limits of integration.

Formula:
\int_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a), \text{ where } F'(x) = f(x)

Worked Example:
Problem: Evaluate \int_0^1 x^2 dx.
Solution: An antiderivative of x^2 is F(x) = x^3/3. By FTC Part 2, the value is F(1) - F(0) = (1^3/3) - (0^3/3) = 1/3.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 7: Integration of Exponential Functions
================================================================================
ID: integration_exponential_functions
Difficulty: easy

Context:
This formula is used to find the antiderivative of exponential functions with any base 'a'. A special case is when the base is 'e', where ln(e)=1, simplifying the formula to \int e^{kx} dx = \frac{e^{kx}}{k} + C.

Formula:
\int a^{kx} dx = \frac{a^{kx}}{k \ln a} + C

Worked Example:
Problem: Find \int 4^{3x} dx.
Solution: Using the formula with a=4 and k=3, we get \frac{4^{3x}}{3 \ln 4} + C.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 8: Basic Trigonometric Integrals
================================================================================
ID: integration_basic_trigonometric_functions
Difficulty: easy

Context:
This concept involves the direct recall and application of standard integral formulas for trigonometric functions like sin, cos, sec^2, etc. These are reverse differentiation rules.

Formula:
\int \sec^2(ax) dx = \frac{1}{a}\tan(ax) + C

Worked Example:
Problem: Find \int \sec^2(5x) dx.
Solution: The integral of sec^2(u) is tan(u). Applying the chain rule in reverse (or a quick u-sub), we get \frac{1}{5}\tan(5x) + C.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 9: Integration by U-Substitution
================================================================================
ID: integration_by_u_substitution
Difficulty: medium
Prerequisites: power_rule_integration, chain_rule_differentiation

Context:
U-substitution is the primary technique for reversing the chain rule. It is used when the integrand contains both a function and its derivative, allowing a complex integral to be simplified into a standard form.

Formula:
\int f(g(x))g'(x) dx = \int f(u) du, \text{ where } u = g(x)

Worked Example:
Problem: Find \int 2x \cos(x^2) dx.
Solution: Let u = x^2, so du = 2x dx. The integral becomes \int \cos(u) du = \sin(u) + C. Substituting back gives \sin(x^2) + C.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 10: U-Substitution Pattern: f'(x)/f(x)
================================================================================
ID: u_substitution_pattern_f_prime_over_f
Difficulty: medium
Prerequisites: integration_by_u_substitution, integration_of_one_over_x

Context:
This is a common and useful pattern for u-substitution. When the numerator of a fractional integrand is the derivative of the denominator, the integral is the natural logarithm of the absolute value of the denominator.

Formula:
\int \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)} dx = \ln|f(x)| + C

Worked Example:
Problem: Find \int \frac{x}{x^2+8} dx.
Solution: Let u = x^2+8, then du = 2x dx. The integral is \frac{1}{2} \int \frac{1}{u} du = \frac{1}{2}\ln|u| + C = \frac{1}{2}\ln(x^2+8) + C.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 11: Integration by Parts
================================================================================
ID: integration_by_parts
Difficulty: medium
Prerequisites: basic_integrals

Context:
This technique is the integration version of the product rule for differentiation. It is used to integrate products of functions, typically when one function becomes simpler upon differentiation and the other is easily integrable.

Formula:
\int u dv = uv - \int v du

Worked Example:
Problem: Find \int x \cos(x) dx.
Solution: Let u=x and dv=\cos(x)dx. Then du=dx and v=\sin(x). Applying the formula: x\sin(x) - \int \sin(x)dx = x\sin(x) + \cos(x) + C.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 12: Special Integral Form: e^x[f(x) + f'(x)]
================================================================================
ID: special_integral_form_e_x_f_plus_f_prime
Difficulty: medium
Prerequisites: integration_by_parts, product_rule_differentiation

Context:
This is a shortcut formula derived from the product rule for differentiation applied to e^x*f(x). Recognizing this pattern allows for immediate integration without performing integration by parts.

Formula:
\int e^x[f(x) + f'(x)] dx = e^x f(x) + C

Worked Example:
Problem: Find \int e^x(\tan^{-1}x + \frac{1}{1+x^2})dx.
Solution: Here, f(x) = \tan^{-1}x and f'(x) = \frac{1}{1+x^2}. The integral fits the pattern, so the answer is e^x \tan^{-1}x + C.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 13: Integrals Leading to Inverse Tangent
================================================================================
ID: integrals_leading_to_inverse_tangent
Difficulty: medium
Prerequisites: integration_by_u_substitution

Context:
This standard integration formula results in the inverse tangent function. It is used for integrands that are rational functions with a sum of squares in the denominator.

Formula:
\int \frac{1}{a^2 + x^2} dx = \frac{1}{a} \tan^{-1}(\frac{x}{a}) + C

Worked Example:
Problem: Find \int \frac{1}{25+x^2} dx.
Solution: This matches the formula with a=5. The result is \frac{1}{5}\tan^{-1}(\frac{x}{5}) + C.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 14: Integrals Leading to Inverse Sine
================================================================================
ID: integrals_leading_to_inverse_sine
Difficulty: medium
Prerequisites: integration_by_u_substitution

Context:
This standard integration formula results in the inverse sine function. It applies to integrands with a constant squared minus a variable squared under a square root in the denominator.

Formula:
\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}} dx = \sin^{-1}(\frac{x}{a}) + C

Worked Example:
Problem: Find \int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{9-x^2}}.
Solution: This matches the formula with a=3. The result is \sin^{-1}(\frac{x}{3}) + C.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 15: Integration Using Half-Angle Identities
================================================================================
ID: integration_using_trig_identities_half_angle
Difficulty: medium
Prerequisites: basic_trig_integrals, trigonometric_identities

Context:
Even powers of sine and cosine cannot be integrated directly. These identities are used to reduce the power of the trigonometric function, transforming the integrand into a form that can be easily integrated.

Formula:
\cos^2(x) = \frac{1+\cos(2x)}{2}; \sin^2(x) = \frac{1-\cos(2x)}{2}

Worked Example:
Problem: Find \int \cos^2(3x) dx.
Solution: Use the identity: \int \frac{1+\cos(6x)}{2} dx = \frac{1}{2}\int(1+\cos(6x))dx = \frac{1}{2}(x + \frac{\sin(6x)}{6}) + C.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 16: Integration after Inverse Trig Simplification
================================================================================
ID: integration_after_inverse_trig_simplification
Difficulty: medium
Prerequisites: inverse_trigonometric_functions, trigonometric_identities

Context:
Some integrands involve compositions of trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions. These can often be greatly simplified using identities before integration is attempted.

Formula:
\sin^{-1}(\sin(x)) = x; \tan^{-1}(\tan(x)) = x

Worked Example:
Problem: Find \int \sin^{-1}(\cos x) dx.
Solution: First, simplify using the identity \cos(x) = \sin(\frac{\pi}{2}-x). The integrand becomes \sin^{-1}(\sin(\frac{\pi}{2}-x)) = \frac{\pi}{2}-x. Now integrate: \int (\frac{\pi}{2}-x) dx = \frac{\pi x}{2} - \frac{x^2}{2} + C.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 17: Definite Integral of an Odd Function over a Symmetric Interval
================================================================================
ID: definite_integral_property_odd_function
Difficulty: medium
Prerequisites: fundamental_theorem_of_calculus_part2, function_parity

Context:
This property is a powerful shortcut for definite integrals. If the function is odd (symmetric about the origin) and the interval is symmetric about zero, the net area is zero as the positive and negative areas cancel perfectly.

Formula:
\text{If } f(-x) = -f(x), \text{ then } \int_{-a}^{a} f(x) dx = 0

Worked Example:
Problem: Evaluate \int_{-1}^{1} x^3 dx.
Solution: The function f(x)=x^3 is odd since f(-x)=(-x)^3=-x^3=-f(x). The interval [-1, 1] is symmetric. Therefore, the integral is 0.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 18: Additivity Property of Definite Integrals
================================================================================
ID: definite_integral_property_additivity
Difficulty: medium
Prerequisites: fundamental_theorem_of_calculus_part2

Context:
This property allows a definite integral to be split into two or more integrals over adjacent intervals. It is particularly useful for piecewise functions or when given information about integrals over different intervals.

Formula:
\int_a^c f(x) dx = \int_a^b f(x) dx + \int_b^c f(x) dx

Worked Example:
Problem: Given \int_1^3 g(x) dx = -3 and \int_3^8 g(x) dx = 10, find \int_1^8 g(x) dx.
Solution: By additivity, \int_1^8 g(x) dx = \int_1^3 g(x) dx + \int_3^8 g(x) dx = -3 + 10 = 7.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 19: Changing Limits of Integration in U-Substitution
================================================================================
ID: changing_limits_in_u_substitution
Difficulty: medium
Prerequisites: integration_by_u_substitution, fundamental_theorem_of_calculus_part2

Context:
When using u-substitution for a definite integral, the limits of integration, which are x-values, must be converted to corresponding u-values. This avoids the need to substitute back to the original variable x after integrating.

Formula:
\int_a^b f(g(x))g'(x) dx = \int_{g(a)}^{g(b)} f(u) du

Worked Example:
Problem: Evaluate \int_0^1 (2x+1)^3 dx.
Solution: Let u = 2x+1, so du = 2dx. When x=0, u=1. When x=1, u=3. The integral becomes \frac{1}{2}\int_1^3 u^3 du = \frac{1}{2}[\frac{u^4}{4}]_1^3 = \frac{1}{8}(3^4 - 1^4) = \frac{80}{8} = 10.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 20: Definite Integral of an Absolute Value Function
================================================================================
ID: definite_integral_of_absolute_value_function
Difficulty: medium
Prerequisites: definite_integral_property_additivity

Context:
To integrate an absolute value function, you must split the integral at the points where the expression inside the absolute value equals zero. The function is then rewritten as a piecewise function without the absolute value bars.

Formula:
\int_a^b |f(x)| dx = \int_a^c -f(x) dx + \int_c^b f(x) dx, \text{ where } f(c)=0

Worked Example:
Problem: Evaluate \int_0^2 |x-1| dx.
Solution: The expression x-1 is zero at x=1. We split the integral: \int_0^1 -(x-1) dx + \int_1^2 (x-1) dx = [x-x^2/2]_0^1 + [x^2/2-x]_1^2 = (1-1/2) - (0) + (4/2-2) - (1/2-1) = 1/2 + 0 - (-1/2) = 1.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 21: Geometric Interpretation of the Definite Integral
================================================================================
ID: geometric_interpretation_of_definite_integral
Difficulty: easy
Prerequisites: definition_of_integral

Context:
For a non-negative function, the definite integral from 'a' to 'b' represents the area of the region enclosed by the function's graph, the x-axis, and the vertical lines x=a and x=b. For functions that go below the x-axis, it represents the net signed area.

Formula:
\text{Area} = \int_a^b f(x) dx, \text{ for } f(x) \geq 0

Worked Example:
Problem: What does \int_0^4 (4x-x^2) dx represent geometrically?
Solution: It represents the area of the region bounded by the parabola y = 4x-x^2 and the x-axis, between x=0 and x=4.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 22: Area Under a Curve
================================================================================
ID: area_under_curve
Difficulty: medium
Prerequisites: fundamental_theorem_of_calculus_part2

Context:
This is a direct application of the definite integral to calculate the area of a plane region. The process involves setting up the correct definite integral with the proper limits (points of intersection) and integrand, then evaluating it.

Formula:
A = \int_a^b f(x) dx

Worked Example:
Problem: Find the area bounded by y=ln(x), the x-axis, and the line x=e.
Solution: The area is given by \int_1^e \ln(x) dx. Using integration by parts, this evaluates to [x\ln(x)-x]_1^e = (e\ln(e)-e) - (1\ln(1)-1) = (e-e) - (0-1) = 1.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 23: Solving a Basic Differential Equation by Direct Integration
================================================================================
ID: solving_basic_differential_equation
Difficulty: easy
Prerequisites: power_rule_integration

Context:
The simplest type of differential equation can be solved by directly integrating the function of x. This process finds the general solution, which includes an arbitrary constant 'C'.

Formula:
\text{If } \frac{dy}{dx} = f(x), \text{ then } y = \int f(x) dx

Worked Example:
Problem: Solve \frac{dy}{dx} = x^4 + 12.
Solution: Integrate both sides with respect to x: y = \int(x^4+12)dx = \frac{x^5}{5} + 12x + C.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 24: Solving a Separable Differential Equation
================================================================================
ID: solving_separable_differential_equation
Difficulty: medium
Prerequisites: solving_basic_differential_equation

Context:
A differential equation is separable if all y terms can be moved to one side and all x terms to the other. After separating the variables, integrate both sides to find the solution.

Formula:
\text{If } \frac{dy}{dx} = g(x)h(y), \text{ then } \int \frac{dy}{h(y)} = \int g(x) dx

Worked Example:
Problem: Solve \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\sin x}{\sin y}.
Solution: Separate variables: \sin(y)dy = \sin(x)dx. Integrate both sides: \int \sin(y)dy = \int \sin(x)dx, which gives -\cos(y) = -\cos(x) + K, or \cos(y) - \cos(x) = C.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 25: Finding the Constant of Integration (Initial Value Problem)
================================================================================
ID: initial_value_problem
Difficulty: medium
Prerequisites: solving_basic_differential_equation

Context:
The general solution to an indefinite integral contains a constant 'C'. An initial condition (a known point on the curve) allows for the specific value of C to be determined, yielding a particular solution.

Formula:
y = \int f'(x) dx = F(x) + C

Worked Example:
Problem: Find the function y if y' = 2x and the graph passes through (1, 4).
Solution: Integrate to find the general solution: y = \int 2x dx = x^2 + C. Use the point (1, 4) to find C: 4 = 1^2 + C, so C=3. The particular solution is y = x^2+3.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 26: Order and Degree of a Differential Equation
================================================================================
ID: order_and_degree_of_de
Difficulty: easy

Context:
The order of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative present. The degree is the highest power of the highest-order derivative, after the equation has been cleared of radicals and fractions in its derivatives.

Worked Example:
Problem: Find the order and degree of (\frac{d^2y}{dx^2})^3 + \frac{dy}{dx} = y.
Solution: The highest derivative is the second derivative, so the order is 2. The power of this highest derivative is 3, so the degree is 3.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 27: Finding Order and Degree after Algebraic Manipulation
================================================================================
ID: order_and_degree_of_de_with_manipulation
Difficulty: medium
Prerequisites: order_and_degree_of_de

Context:
Before determining the degree of a differential equation, it is essential to eliminate any fractional powers of the derivatives. This often involves squaring or cubing both sides of the equation.

Worked Example:
Problem: Find the order and degree of (1+(\frac{dy}{dx})^2)^{3/2} = \frac{d^2y}{dx^2}.
Solution: Square both sides to clear the fractional exponent: (1+(\frac{dy}{dx})^2)^3 = (\frac{d^2y}{dx^2})^2. The highest derivative is d^2y/dx^2, so the order is 2. Its power is 2, so the degree is 2.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 28: Property of Antiderivatives
================================================================================
ID: antiderivatives_differ_by_constant
Difficulty: easy

Context:
This fundamental property states that any two antiderivatives (or indefinite integrals) of the same function can only differ by a constant. This is why the '+ C' is essential in indefinite integration.

Formula:
\text{If } F'(x)=f(x) \text{ and } G'(x)=f(x), \text{ then } F(x) - G(x) = C

Worked Example:
Problem: If F(x)=x^2 and G(x)=x^2+5 are both antiderivatives of f(x)=2x, what is their difference?
Solution: F(x) - G(x) = x^2 - (x^2+5) = -5, which is a constant.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 29: Standard Integral Formula for e^(ax)cos(bx)
================================================================================
ID: standard_integral_formula_e_ax_cos_bx
Difficulty: medium
Prerequisites: integration_by_parts

Context:
This is a standard result obtained by applying integration by parts twice and solving for the original integral. It's often memorized as a formula to save time.

Formula:
\int e^{ax} \cos(bx) dx = \frac{e^{ax}}{a^2+b^2}(a \cos bx + b \sin bx) + C

Worked Example:
Problem: Find \int e^{2x}\cos(3x) dx.
Solution: Using the formula with a=2 and b=3: \frac{e^{2x}}{2^2+3^2}(2\cos(3x) + 3\sin(3x)) + C = \frac{e^{2x}}{13}(2\cos(3x) + 3\sin(3x)) + C.


================================================================================
CONCEPT 30: Definite Integral of the Greatest Integer Function
================================================================================
ID: definite_integral_of_greatest_integer_function
Difficulty: hard
Prerequisites: definite_integral_property_additivity, definition_of_greatest_integer_function

Context:
The greatest integer function [x] is a step function. To integrate it, the interval of integration must be broken down into subintervals between consecutive integers, over which the function's value is constant.

Formula:
\int_a^b [x] dx, \text{ where [x] is the greatest integer } \leq x

Worked Example:
Problem: Evaluate \int_2^4 [x] dx.
Solution: Split the integral at integer values: \int_2^3 [x] dx + \int_3^4 [x] dx. On [2,3), [x]=2. On [3,4), [x]=3. The integral becomes \int_2^3 2 dx + \int_3^4 3 dx = 2(3-2) + 3(4-3) = 2(1) + 3(1) = 5.
